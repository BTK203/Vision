Since this is a rough version, I won't work too hard on a GUI for updating values at runtime yet. Here are commands for Dev mode:
"c" - allows user to change target colors during runtime
"t" - allows user to change target threshold during runtime
"time" - returns a summary of how much time threads are taking
"current" - shows all values that can be modified (so right now its color and threshold)
"quit" - exits the program
