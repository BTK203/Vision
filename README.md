# Vision
A Computer Vision repository full of code for Raspberry Pi that makes it see things with USB cameras. It is not finished. Only java build does stuff

The java version of this repository is a heavily edited version of the starter repository provided by FIRST. Inital repository found here: https://github.com/wpilibsuite/VisionBuildSamples/

Python coming soon!
C++ maybe coming soon...

NOTE: The code from this repository is only tested for Raspberry pi running Raspbian. Run at your own risk if you heckin be running it on anything else >:D

How its going: 
--
Java: Too slow, so got to binary imaging and basically stopped because we figured python/C++ would be much faster, so don't use the Java code because its not going to work.

Python: Working on it...

C++: Also working on it, no promises
